## by Amitai Levi

## About the app

This is a client side ToDo list for personal use. My goal is to make your life more efficiant and orgenized!
The app has many features, please read below for more information.

- [ChallengeMe]()

## Features

First I recommend to start with the tutorials to see most of the app's features.Features display wiil be in the end of the page. Anyway, this is the features:

- Tutorial, as mentioned above
- Adding a task that includes the task text, priority (a number between 1-5), and the date it was created
- Task counter
- Sort button to sort the tasks by priority
- Persistant data - the data is saved in [JsonBin](https://jsonbin.io/) so it's accessable from anywhere and any time.
- Delete or edit a task
- Undo and Redo actions
- Search bar
- Drag'n'drop to reorder tasks
- Clear button to delete all tasks at once
- save button - so you won't save actions you did by accident
- 2 additional tests - for clear and delete buttons

## Resorces links

Except [drag n' drop functionality](https://htmldom.dev/drag-and-drop-element-in-a-list), I have no specific resorce that I have only been used it on a function. Altough, I took a lot of information from the internet, and specieficly from these speciefic sites:

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/he/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
- [GitHub support community](https://github.community/)
- [FreeCodeCamp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/)
  An element for showing the numeric priority value of the task, with a class `todo-priority`

      .persist()
      .put(/.*/, () => true)

    expect(elements.length).toBe(0);
  });
  test("Clicking the clear button should delete all tasks", async () => {
    await nock("https://api.jsonbin.io/v3").get(/.*/).reply(200, mocks.initBin);

    await nock("https://api.jsonbin.io/v3")
      .persist()
      .put(/.*/, () => true)
      .reply(200, mocks.toDoAddResponse);

    await page.goto(path, { waitUntil: "networkidle0" });

    await page.type("#text-input", "can you delete me?");
    await page.click("#add-button");

    await page.type("#text-input", "maybe so");
    await page.click("#add-button");

    await page.type("#text-input", "but can you clear all of us in 1 click?");
    await page.click("#add-button");

    await page.click("#clear-button");
    await page.click("#save");

    let clearBtn = "";
    clearBtn = await page.$$("#clear-button");
    await page.waitFor("#clear-button", { innerText: "cleared" });

    const elements = await page.$$(".todo-text");
    expect(elements.length).toBe(0);
  });
```

- Add a counter element to reflect the **current** number of todos stored in the app. This element should have an id of `counter`.

- Add a button with id `sort-button`. Clicking this element should resort the todo list by their todos priority (DESC)

  ![alt text](./readme-files/todo.gif)

- **Make your todo-list persistent!**

  Save your todo-list as JSON (see `todo-list-example.json`) and store it in a persistent way, you have to options:

  1. Use the `localStorage` browser api to save / load the todo-list JSON **with the 'my-todo' key**. This option will make it persist between _page reloads_.

  2. Use the [jsonbin.io](https://jsonbin.io/) service api (using async/await fetch GET & PUT requests) to save / load your todo-list JSON. This option will make it persist across _devices and browsers_.

**Note** You can add extra properties to the todo objects in the JSON that you want to be persistent.
